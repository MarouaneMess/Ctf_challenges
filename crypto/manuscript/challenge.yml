  An archaeologist discovered an ancient manuscript in a hidden tomb. 
  The text appears to be encrypted, and the archaeologist believes it holds the key to a long-lost treasure. 
  Can you decode the manuscript and uncover the secret?
  The key to unlocking the secret is "ZNAHFPEVCG".
hints:
  - "The manuscript was written in a time when Caesar ruled the minds of men."
  - "The flag is protected by a polyalphabetic cipher. (maybe we can give this hint if they didn't find 'Vigen√®re cipher')"
